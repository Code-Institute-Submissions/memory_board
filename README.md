# **Football Memory Game**

**The Aim of This Game.**

The main aim for this project is to design a game that is easy to play and, with the varying degrees of difficulty, is challenging but not impossible.
It is aimed at all age groups with the purpose if trying to improve your score by using the lowest amount of flips you can. 
The easy level would work well for younger children while improving their memory and also their hand eye coordination. 

The most important aim is for the user to have fun and enjoy the challenge. 

## **UX**

1. As a user I want a game that is quick and easy to understand.

2. I would want basic instructions that are easy to follow.
3. As a player,  I want a subject matter that interests me (in this case football).
4. As a player, I need a game that is challenging but also achievable with practice.
5. I want a game that is playable by all age groups.
6. As a parent I would want a game that helps a childs development.
7. As a player I want to have a target to beat to encourage me to continue. 
8. As a user I would want a site that is easy to understand and navigate through.


## **Features** ##

### **Existing Features** ###

On the front page all buttons are clear.

- *How to Play:* When clicked this gives full and concise insruction on how to play the game.

- *Time:* This will count down from 90 seconds, showing how much time you have left to play before GAME OVER.
- *Levels:* There are three levels, Easy, Medium and Hard. The level you are on is clearly highlighted. To move to another level just click on whichever you want to try. All levels have a time limit of 90 seconds but become increasingly more difficult due to the amount of pairs required. 

1. Easy Level has 24 cards so 12 pairs to be found
2. Medium Level has 32 cards so 16 pairs to be found 
3. Hard Level has 40 cards so 20 pairs to be found. 

- *Flips:* This shows the number of cards you have flipped over in order to complete the level. The object is to try to finish the level with the fewest amount of flips. 

- *YOU WIN:* On completion of the game you will see a pop up message saying "YOU WIN" Click to play again. When you click on it the game will restart with the cards shuffled into different positions. 

- *GAME OVER:* If you fail to complete the game within the 90 seconds you will see a pop up message saying "GAME OVER" Click to restart. Whe you click on it the game will restart with the cards shuffled into different positions.


### **Features Left to Implement** ###

1. I would like to add some music and sound effects to the game. For instance
- Background music whilst the game is being played.
- Sound effect on finding a matching pair.
- Sound effect for winning the game.
- Sound effect for losing game.

2. Scoreboard. If you have completed a level a scoreboard showing the number of flips and the time remaining. There would be a top 10 scores showing for the day and an all time top score to beat.

3. Within the scoreboard a place to type you name to show who has the best score if you had a competition.

4. I would add a HELP button that, when pressed, would flash up two or three pairs within the game to help if you are stuck and time is running out.
